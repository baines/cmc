This was the beginnings a C99 minecraft client that I wrote ages ago but never
released.

It interoperated with the official Java server protocol for some old version,
~~maybe beta 1.2? I can't remember...~~ turns out it's 1.2.5

It only got far enough to parse the packets, reply to enough of them to stay
online, and (poorly) render the world.
